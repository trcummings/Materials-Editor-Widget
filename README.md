# To run this MF, U must simply

`node mockBackend.js`
then in a separate terminal tab `npm run dev`

You must be on node version 10 or later to run these tests

QUESTIONS:

- Is the date format in the mocks that way because Smart Construction is being developed for a Japanese company?

MINOR TODOs:

- add titles to all elements that deserve them
- number input arrows (NICE TO HAVE)
- validate form inputs
- ensure datepicker cannot pick a date prior to the current date
- debounce inputs
